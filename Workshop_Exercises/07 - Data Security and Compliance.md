In this exercise, you have learned how to manage access control in Microsoft Fabric using Workspace roles and SQL native access controls. You have gained practical experience in:
 
- Understanding the four workspace roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer) and their corresponding database permissions.
- Configuring SQL native access controls using the Manage SQL Security UI and Transact-SQL commands.

With this knowledge, you can now effectively manage user permissions and secure SQL Databases within Microsoft Fabric.

With all the above transformations, you will help Contoso and April achieve an all-green dashboard. Imagine what you can do with SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric for your organization. The possibilities are limitless!
